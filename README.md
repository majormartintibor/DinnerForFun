# DinnerForFun

This is a quick a dirty proof of concept. 
The goal is to show a version slider on the UI (ShowDinner.razor.cs) with which the user can time travel in the stream of events.

Exception handling, cross cutting concerns like logging, creating seperate components for the ViewModels, 
encapsualting queries / comamnds or abstracting away Martens document store are all not scope of this POC.
